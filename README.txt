**Make sure to run all the codes sequentially.
**It is a working code. However, it may take a long time to run for the following code chunks below. Please consider before running those chunks.


1. The random forest chunk takes about 30 minutes to run due to grid search like method for hyper parameter tuning.

2. Also expect about 30 minutes to run all the SVM rbf and poly code chunks. The algorithm just takes too long to run (I commented out the 2D visualization code since it adds about another 30 minute on run time)
