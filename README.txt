**Make sure to run all the codes sequentially. I usually just hit Shift + Enter multiple times until the end of code chunk.
**It is a working code. I verified myself. However, it may take a long time to run for the following code chunks below. Please consider before running those chunks.


1. The random forest chunk takes about 30 minutes to run, it is beacuse I used grid search like method for hyper parameter tuning.

2. Also expect about 30 minutes to run all the SVM rbf and poly code chunks. The algorithm just takes too long to run (I commented out the 2D visualization code since it adds about another 30 minute on run time)

3. the markdown notes and comments were added to make what I did self-explanatory. For any questions email me at mcho1234@gmail.com or mcho@stthomas.edu
