#### Feel free to test the notebook out!

#### A few things to watch:
*Make sure to run all the codes sequentially.*
*Long execution time for the below mentioned code chunks.*


1. Random forest chunk: uses grid search like method for hyper parameter tuning.

2. All of VM rbf and poly code chunks. The algorithm uses rbf kernel which is computaionally expensive. (2D visualization code is commented out. Please uncomment to test)
