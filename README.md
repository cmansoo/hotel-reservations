Feel free to test the notebook out!

A few things to watch:
**Make sure to run all the codes sequentially.
**Long execution time for the below mentioned code chunks.


1. The random forest chunk takes about 30 minutes to run due to grid search like method for hyper parameter tuning.

2. Also expect about 30 minutes to run all the SVM rbf and poly code chunks. The algorithm just takes too long to run (I commented out the 2D visualization code since it adds about another 30 minute on run time)
